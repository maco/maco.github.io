Also, I mentioned that I had started studying Swahili.
Kenya Nairobi My group of Quakers (Baltimore Yearly Meeting) is associated with both Friends General Conference (more liberal, no pastors) and Friends United Meeting (often more conservative, usually pastors). Every 3 years, FUM has their triennial. Ok, that&amp;rsquo;s obvious in the name. Anyway, the largest group of FUM Quakers is in Kenya, and it was their turn to host.</description></item><item><title>Well, that's a Friday</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/well-thats-a-friday/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:09:29 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/well-thats-a-friday/</guid><description>This past Friday, I spoke at Code Beam America, and The Quaker World was published.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken at many conferences in the last decade. I did the Elixir Wizards one virtually last year, and this is the first time in person since 2011.
It&amp;rsquo;s just a surprising coincidence that the book was published the same day. I wrote that chapter two years ago!</description></item><item><title>Byzantine Easter</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/byzantine-easter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 08:34:55 -0400</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/byzantine-easter/</guid><description>Like much of Pittsburgh, I am ethnically Rusyn. I was raised mostly Roman Catholic (because my dad is). At Easter, though, I always attended Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church, where my mom&amp;rsquo;s family belongs.
Byzantine Catholics have very different Easter traditions than many other Christians, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice until I experienced culture shock the time we took our basket to be blessed at the Roman Catholic parish where I grew up, and my basket was decidedly different from the others.</description></item><item><title>Quakers &amp; Forced Assimilation of Native Americans</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/quakers-forced-assimilation-native-americans/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 09:19:28 -0400</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/quakers-forced-assimilation-native-americans/</guid><description>Quakers were heavily involved in the forced-assimilation of Native Americans.
Today, through the Friends Committee on National Legislation (the Quaker lobbyist), we advocate for Native rights and Native sovereignty. FCNL employs Portia Kay^nthos Skenandore-Wheelock, a member of the Oneida Nation to run its Native American Congressional Advocacy Program. It was previously run by Kerri Colfer of the Tlingit Nation, and before that Lacina Tangnaqudo Onco of the Shinnecock &amp;amp; Kiowa Nations.</description></item><item><title>Finding Quakers</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/finding-quakers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 00:35:47 -0400</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/finding-quakers/</guid><description><![CDATA[Trying to find Quakers near you?
