You see all those &ldquo;entry-level&rdquo; jobs that expect a year or three of experience. Networking is incredibly important, especially if you don&rsquo;t have any professional experience in the tech industry yet.
We&rsquo;ve all heard it: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not what you know; it&rsquo;s who you know.]]></description></item><item><title>Elixir Wizards Talk: "Dealing With a Monster Ecto Query"</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/elixir-wizards-talk/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 00:27:31 -0400</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/elixir-wizards-talk/</guid><description>Last month, I spoke at the first-ever Elixir Wizards Conference. It was a lightning talk walking through a refactor I did before the 2020 US Presidential Election, titled &amp;ldquo;Dealing With a Monster Ecto Query.&amp;rdquo;
I work for a news company, so the presidential election is a huge deal; we can&amp;rsquo;t have downtime. I knew which query was our bottleneck, so I optimized it right before the election. This took advantage of a few Elixir features, like atoms, the pin operator, and concurrency primitives.</description></item><item><title>Quakers &amp; Forced Assimilation of Native Americans</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/quakers-forced-assimilation-native-americans/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 09:19:28 -0400</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/quakers-forced-assimilation-native-americans/</guid><description>Quakers were heavily involved in the forced-assimilation of Native Americans.
Today, through the Friends Committee on National Legislation (the Quaker lobbyist), we advocate for Native rights and Native sovereignty. FCNL employs Portia Kay^nthos Skenandore-Wheelock, a member of the Oneida Nation to run its Native American Congressional Advocacy Program. It was previously run by Kerri Colfer of the Tlingit Nation, and before that Lacina Tangnaqudo Onco of the Shinnecock &amp;amp; Kiowa Nations.</description></item><item><title>Finding Quakers</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/finding-quakers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 00:35:47 -0400</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/finding-quakers/</guid><description><![CDATA[Trying to find Quakers near you?

One of the first things you learn from the basic syntax guide on the Elixir website is that hd(foo) gets the first thing in a list, and tl(foo) gets the rest. You also learn [ head | tail ] = foo.
But what happens when it&amp;rsquo;s an empty list?
iex(1)&amp;gt; foo = [] [] iex(2)&amp;gt; hd(foo) ** (ArgumentError) argument error :erlang.</description></item><item><title>Dang, Elixir is stable</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/dang-elixir-is-stable/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Mar 2021 21:12:59 -0400</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/dang-elixir-is-stable/</guid><description>On Monday, my manager asked about on-call coverage for the Elixir app I work on. There are only a handful of people in the company who know Elixir, and he was concerned that I would feel like I couldn&amp;rsquo;t take a vacation.
Him: How often do you get on-call alerts?
Me: shrug Never üòè
Him: Wait, what? Do you have them set up? Do they work? üò∞
Me: Yeah, they&amp;rsquo;re set up, and yes, they work, but the interval&amp;hellip;Two weeks ago, another team made a change that affected us without telling us, and that caused an alert.</description></item><item><title>Attending Code BEAM</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/attending-code-beam/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Mar 2021 14:39:55 -0500</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/attending-code-beam/</guid><description><![CDATA[Last week, Miriam Pena from the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation&rsquo;s education working group mentioned in the Elixir Slack&rsquo;s channel for women and other minority genders that Code BEAM V America was coming up. She said the working group had a handful of tickets available for students, folks who can&rsquo;t otherwise afford to go, and people in groups that are underrepresented in tech.
I&rsquo;ve never applied for a &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; ticket to a conference before, but she said they&rsquo;d pre-purchased them, and the conference was 6 days away.]]></description></item><item><title>Django Admin color picker</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/django-admin-color-picker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Nov 2020 03:09:31 -0500</pubDate><author>Author</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/django-admin-color-picker/</guid><description><![CDATA[When I add a new model to the Django app at work, I try to make sure the results in the Django admin have good usability, too. Just because it&rsquo;ll be mainly developers (and a few project managers) seeing it doesn&rsquo;t mean I can neglect usability. Consequently, I spend some time on hacking the Django admin.
