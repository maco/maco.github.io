She said the working group had a handful of tickets available for students, folks who can&rsquo;t otherwise afford to go, and people in groups that are underrepresented in tech.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve never applied for a &ldquo;diversity&rdquo; ticket to a conference before, but she said they&rsquo;d pre-purchased them, and the conference was 6 days away. Also, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nVgAcy9wB0" target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">2020 Elixir survey results</a> say the community is 2% women, which is rather like the open source numbers back when I started doing that. (I hope the open source numbers have grown?) So, I figured it was probably ok to claim one.</p><p>I know I&rsquo;ve traditionally been pretty bad at taking notes at conferences, so this time I looked for advice online and landed on a modified version of the Cornell System. The outer margin has keywords, and the main area has notes. The bottom has a summary.</p><h2 id=conference-tech>Conference tech</h2><p>The conference used <a href=https://www.whova.com target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Whova</a> as a platform for connecting between attendees. Actual presentations were done with Zoom, but it was embedded in Whova. Videos were uploaded the same day, which was great! That really handles the &ldquo;oh no, I want to go to two at the same time&rdquo; problem nicely. They used <a href=https://toucan.events target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Toucan</a> for the hallway track. Toucan was really cool. It did a good job of the &ldquo;several groups of people standing around together&rdquo; feel. The next <a href=https://www.meetup.com/DC-Elixir/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">DC Elixir meetup</a> is going to use it.</p><h2 id=the-actual-conference>The actual conference</h2><h3 id=observability>Observability</h3><p>Anyway, about the content. I went to a couple sessions on observability. I already use <a href=https://grafana.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Grafana</a> and <a href=https://honeycomb.io target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Honeycomb</a> at work. I was more interested in the advice about what and how to monitor than in how to set it up, since I&rsquo;m already using them. (Though I did go looking into how to get per-function spans in Honeycomb, and I landed on <a href=https://hex.pm/packages/telemetry_decorator target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Telemetry Decorator</a>.)</p><h3 id=tech-debt>Tech debt</h3><p><a href=https://hachyderm.io/@jessitron target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Jessica Kerr</a> and <a href=https://chelseatroy.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Chelsea Troy</a> talked about &ldquo;addressing escalating risks in our code base,&rdquo; which was mostly a fancy way of saying &ldquo;tech debt.&rdquo; The big tip they started with was that talking about &ldquo;risk&rdquo; makes management listen. Plus, &ldquo;debt&rdquo; can sound like it all has one solution, whereas risks are more clearly differentiated.</p><blockquote><p>The ability to change the code does not lie in the code; it lies in the relationship between the code and the developers who understand it.” — Jessica Kerr at Code BEAM V</p></blockquote><p>I liked the holistic view of they brought to the discussion. Incomplete, out-of-date, and hard-to-find documentation are all risky. Lost institutional knowledge is risky. And updates you didn&rsquo;t install because &ldquo;if nothing changes, it&rsquo;s stable&rdquo; is risky, since there may be security holes in your libraries.</p><h3 id=phoenix-live-view>Phoenix Live View</h3><p>I really want to try Live View in my next personal project. <a href=http://sophiedebenedetto.nyc/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Sophie DeBenedetto</a> & <a href=https://techhub.social/@redrapids target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Bruce Tate</a> have a <a href=https://pragprog.com/titles/liveview/programming-phoenix-liveview/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">new book on Live View</a> coming out later this year, and it&rsquo;s already available for beta readers. I&rsquo;d pick it up right away, if I didn&rsquo;t feel like I ought to read the basic <a href=https://pragprog.com/titles/phoenix14/programming-phoenix-1-4/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Phoenix book</a> first. (Yes, I&rsquo;ve been using Phoenix for the last year, but only to build a GraphQL API, not using the rest of the functionality.)</p><h3 id=machine-learning>Machine Learning</h3><p>I am not a math person, so I didn&rsquo;t get a whole lot out of this. The basic thing sounded like <a href=https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Nx</a> is supposed to bring Elixir up to <a href=https://numpy.org/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">NumPy</a>&rsquo;s speed. It&rsquo;s supposed to be compatible with <a href=https://www.tensorflow.org/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">TensorFlow</a>, and they talked about GPUs doing calculations. So, that&rsquo;s really neat, and I hope mathy people are able to make good use of Elixir for their machine learning magic.</p><h3 id=software-correctness>Software Correctness</h3><p>There are two sessions I think fit this category. One was on property-based testing. The other was on contract programming.</p><p>Property-based testing is meant to mimic the random stuff real users do. It&rsquo;s like fuzzing for functionality. The idea is that instead of writing test cases, which (let&rsquo;s face it) often tend to focus on the &ldquo;happy path,&rdquo; you write a model of how it should work, then throw random data at it and see if it stays within its constraints. I imagine this involves a finite state machine.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll need to grab Fred Hebert&rsquo;s <a href=https://pragprog.com/titles/fhproper/property-based-testing-with-proper-erlang-and-elixir/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">new book on property-based testing</a>.</p><p>Contract programming is something I just read about in <a href=https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>. It&rsquo;s about ensuring a contract between the calling and answering function. Strong typing is at least a part of it. In Elixir, <a href=https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/specifics/debugging/#dialyxir-and-dialyzer target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Dialyxir</a> provides static analysis of types.</p><h3 id=elixir-adoption>Elixir Adoption</h3><p><a href=https://github.com/sundikhin target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Sundi Myint</a> and <a href=https://bgmarx.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Ben Marx</a> had a session on Elixir adoption. I work in a company that adopted Elixir a year ago, but I still wanted to go to this. I was surprised to hear that recruiters say finding Elixir engineers is easy (thanks to the concentrated community resources, such as the Slack server), since &ldquo;how will we find such niche-language programmers?&rdquo; is a common concern.</p><p>Of course, learning a new programming language isn&rsquo;t all that hard, so you can just hire people for general programming skills and have them learn the language later. I wasn&rsquo;t hired to write Elixir, after all.</p><h3 id=generalized-solutions-->Generalized solutions > *</h3><p>Randall Thomas gave a keynote full of insights into modern programming. I thought he made a good point about a language only being as good as its tooling. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to work in a language with no unit testing framework, for instance. The larger point, though, was about generalization versus specialization. He referenced the books <em>Infinite Game</em> and <em>Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World</em>. If you buid solutions that are too specialized, you&rsquo;re stuck when the problem space expands. At some scale, it was like the open/closed principle, applied to entire codebases or problem spaces instead of just to individual modules.</p><h3 id=other-stuff>Other stuff</h3><p>From the &ldquo;What Ruby can learn from the BEAM&rdquo; talk, I got a reminder that I really need to learn about the actor model. It&rsquo;s how concurrency works in Elixir and Erlang, and Ruby has recently added it, and I have absolutely no memory of learning about it in school.</p><p>I skipped Melvin Cedeno&rsquo;s presentation on teaching functional programming with Elixir, only because I saw him present it a few weeks ago at the <a href=https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Elixir/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreffer">Triangle Elixir meetup</a>. I do recommend it, though.</p><p>I need to go back and watch some of the double-booked sessions, like the one on infrastructure and maybe the security ones. (It&rsquo;s been so long since I got out of infosec, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d still understand those, though.)</p><p>Overall, my &ldquo;to read&rdquo; list increased by at least 3 books in the last week, and that is simply not a sustainable pace for non-fiction.</p></div><div class=post-footer id=post-footer><div class=post-info><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-mod><span>Updated on 2021-03-13</span></div><div class=post-info-license></div></div><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-md></div><div class=post-info-share><span></span></div></div></div><div class=post-info-more><section class=post-tags><i class="fas fa-tags fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;<a href=/tags/elixir/>elixir</a>,&nbsp;<a href=/tags/conference/>conference</a></section><section><span><a href=javascript:void(0); onclick=window.history.back()>Back</a></span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span><a href=/>Home</a></span></section></div><div class=post-nav><a href=/posts/django-admin-color-picker/ class=prev rel=prev title="Django Admin color picker"><i class="fas fa-angle-left fa-fw"></i>Django Admin color picker</a>
