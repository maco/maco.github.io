<h2 id="buenos-aires">Buenos Aires</h2>
<p>I spent the week before Thanksgiving in Buenos Aires. Finally, my spouse got to come along on one of these trips.</p>
<p>We learned you should not arrive in Buenos Aires on a Sunday. Nothing is open. No, you can&rsquo;t buy a sube (metro card) to ride the subte (metro). No, you can&rsquo;t go to Western Union to convert your dollars to pesos. You want to eat breakfast? There are two restaurants within 4 blocks that open before noon. But the weather was lovely, so we spent the morning sitting in various parks, enjoying it, and marveling at the telecoms cables draped from building to building.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>2023 Summary: Part 4</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-4/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 15:00:00 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-4/</guid><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="dance">Dance</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been one to dance at weddings. I was fine dancing ballet as a kid because I was told the order of steps to do. And at SCA events, I&rsquo;d participate in the medieval English country dance. Again, there was a sequence of steps to memorize. But improvisational dance? That was not me.</p>
<p>I decided it was time to get out of my shell and learn how to dance without a script.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>2023 Summary: Part 3</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 14:00:00 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-3/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>When I left off in <a href="/posts/2023-summary-part-2" rel="">part 2</a>, I said I spent July circumnavigating the globe. Also, I mentioned that I had started studying Swahili.</p>
<h2 id="kenya">Kenya</h2>
<h3 id="nairobi">Nairobi</h3>
<p>My group of Quakers (<a href="https://bym-rsf.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Baltimore Yearly Meeting</a>)   is associated with both <a href="https://www.fgcquaker.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Friends General Conference</a> (more liberal, no pastors) and <a href="https://fum.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Friends United Meeting</a> (often more conservative, usually pastors). Every 3 years, FUM has their triennial. Ok, that&rsquo;s obvious in the name. Anyway, the largest group of FUM Quakers is in Kenya, and it was their turn to host. I arrived a day early and met up with one of the other Baltimore folks for a visit to the Giraffe Centre.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>2023 Summary: Part 2</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 13:00:00 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-2/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>In May, I went up to Pittsburgh for Mothers&rsquo; Day weekend. My brother&rsquo;s New Zealand work visa had come through, so he was saying goodbye to the family.</p>
<h2 id="exam-results">Exam results</h2>
<p>In June, I got the notification that I had passed my <a href="https://www.dele.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">DELE exam</a>. Woot!</p>
<p>The breakdown on scoring is a maximum of 25 points each for reading comprehension, writing skill, listening comprehension, and vocal interaction. You need 30 points total between reading and writing and again between listening and speaking.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>2023 Summary: Part 1</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-1/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s the end of December, and I&rsquo;ve barely blogged this year, so I&rsquo;m going to do a wrap-up for the year. 2023 was an <strong>extremely</strong> full year. There was an absolute <strong>ton</strong> of travel and a lot of being usefully bilingual.</p>
<p>There was so much stuff that I&rsquo;m splitting this into <strong>5 parts</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="belgium">Belgium</h2>
<p>At the beginning of February, I went to Belgium to speak in the Elixir/Erlang track at FOSDEM. My friend Nelson was also speaking on that track, and so our mutual friends Pablo and Diego came up from Spain to attend the conference too. We all stayed in the same hotel and stuck together the whole time. We introduced Pablo and Diego to Ethiopian food (Nelson had already tried it with me when visiting DC last year), and we all went to the only Cuban restaurant in Belgium our last night there. After explaining to the Spanish guys what <em>we</em> think of when we hear the word &ldquo;tamal&rdquo; (corn meal, with a stuffing, wrapped in a leaf), Nelson and I were very surprised to learn about tamal en cazuela, which is a casserole: no stuffing, and no leaf. It was tasty, though! Speaking Spanish even came in handy in Belgium in the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t speak French, you don&rsquo;t speak English, any chance we both speak Spanish? Oh good!&rdquo; way.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Things your Spanish teacher didn't tell you</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/things-your-spanish-teacher-didnt-tell-you/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2023 22:54:19 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/things-your-spanish-teacher-didnt-tell-you/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>A friend of mine (a native Spanish speaker) just started teaching one of his friends Spanish, and the first thing I said was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explain to her that ser is essence/identity/characteristic and estar is status, and that’ll go SO much better than the “ser is permanent and estar is temporary” that makes us try to say “es muerto” and “estoy bautista” (because hey, conversion exists). Like, death is pretty permanent, but it’s still a status.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Bulk Delete Twitter Messages</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/bulk-delete-twitter-messages/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Dec 2022 23:43:37 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/bulk-delete-twitter-messages/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Hey, are you leaving Twitter? Are you worried that with 80% of the staff gone, it&rsquo;s just a matter of time until there start being unreported breaches? (Heck, maybe there have already!) Want to ensure anyone breaking into your account doesn&rsquo;t read your messages? Have a bulk-delete script, on the house!</p>
<p>To use this, go to <a href="https://twitter.com/messages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">the messages page</a> on a computer.

In there, go to the tab labeled &ldquo;Console.&rdquo; Paste the following in and hit the enter or return key:</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Well, that's a Friday</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/well-thats-a-friday/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:09:29 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/well-thats-a-friday/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>This past Friday, I spoke at <a href="https://codebeamamerica.com/talks/typing-with-pixie-dust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Code Beam America</a>, and <a href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Quaker-World/Daniels-Grant/p/book/9780367142513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">The Quaker World</a> was published.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t spoken at many conferences in the last decade. I did the Elixir Wizards one virtually last year, and this is the first time in person since 2011.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a surprising coincidence that the book was published the same day. I wrote that chapter <em>two years ago</em>!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Tips &amp; Tools for Learning Spanish</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/tips-tools-learning-spanish/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 10:54:40 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/tips-tools-learning-spanish/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>[updated 2023-01-28]</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve studied a silly number of languages in my life, starting with Spanish from age 6 to 14. I returned to studying Spanish in 2017, when I was working with an Argentine client. We spoke primarily in English (I was far too rusty for the alternative), but I quickly became frustrated with not knowing how to speak in the past tense in Spanish. I hurriedly crammed &ldquo;yo &hellip;é, tú &hellip;aste, él &hellip;ó&rdquo; into my head and tried to keep up.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Byzantine Easter</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/byzantine-easter/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2022 08:34:55 -0400</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/byzantine-easter/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Like much of Pittsburgh, I am ethnically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusyns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Rusyn</a>. I was raised mostly Roman Catholic (because my dad is). At Easter, though, I always attended <a href="https://www.holyghost-byzantinecatholic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church</a>, where my mom&rsquo;s family belongs.</p>
<p>Byzantine Catholics have very different Easter traditions than many other Christians, but I didn&rsquo;t notice until I experienced culture shock the time we took our basket to be blessed at the Roman Catholic parish where I grew up, and my basket was decidedly different from the others. Theirs had plastic eggs and chocolate bunnies. Mine had kolbasi, ham, bacon, pascha, hrudka, chrin, butter, etc. You know, a <em>traditional</em> Easter basket with all the foods for Sunday&rsquo;s fast-breaking.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
