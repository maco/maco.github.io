I haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken at many conferences in the last decade. I did the Elixir Wizards one virtually last year, and this is the first time in person since 2011.
It&amp;rsquo;s just a surprising coincidence that the book was published the same day. I wrote that chapter two years ago!</description></item><item><title>Advent of Code 2021</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/advent-of-code-2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 21:09:29 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/advent-of-code-2021/</guid><description><![CDATA[In general, I regard myself as pretty bad at algorithms. I&rsquo;m comfortable enough doing the Elixir track on Exercism (that&rsquo;s how I learned Elixir), and I&rsquo;ve used HackerRank some, but the reason I used HackerRank was because TripleByte said algorithms were my weak point. (It said architecture was my strong suit, and I&rsquo;m quite pleased with that, as I did put effort into improving on that front.) I really dislike white boarding in job interviews (both because of the nerves factor and because the problems are usually totally unrelated to the job) and so much prefer take-homes.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
