<p>I haven&rsquo;t spoken at many conferences in the last decade. I did the Elixir Wizards one virtually last year, and this is the first time in person since 2011.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a surprising coincidence that the book was published the same day. I wrote that chapter <em>two years ago</em>!</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Advent of Code 2021</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/advent-of-code-2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 21:09:29 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/advent-of-code-2021/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>In general, I regard myself as pretty bad at algorithms. I&rsquo;m comfortable enough doing <a href="https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">the Elixir track on Exercism</a> (that&rsquo;s how I learned Elixir), and I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">HackerRank</a> some, but the reason I used HackerRank was because <a href="https://triplebyte.com/candidates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">TripleByte</a> said algorithms were my weak point. (It said architecture was my strong suit, and I&rsquo;m quite pleased with that, as I did put effort into improving on that front.) I really dislike white boarding in job interviews (both because of the nerves factor and because the problems are usually totally unrelated to the job) and so much prefer take-homes.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
