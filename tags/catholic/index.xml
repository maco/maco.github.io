I was raised mostly Roman Catholic (because my dad is). At Easter, though, I always attended Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church, where my mom&amp;rsquo;s family belongs.
Byzantine Catholics have very different Easter traditions than many other Christians, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice until I experienced culture shock the time we took our basket to be blessed at the Roman Catholic parish where I grew up, and my basket was decidedly different from the others.</description></item></channel></rss>
