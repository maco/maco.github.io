I was raised mostly Roman Catholic (because my dad is). At Easter, though, I always attended <a href="https://www.holyghost-byzantinecatholic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church</a>, where my mom&rsquo;s family belongs.</p>
<p>Byzantine Catholics have very different Easter traditions than many other Christians, but I didn&rsquo;t notice until I experienced culture shock the time we took our basket to be blessed at the Roman Catholic parish where I grew up, and my basket was decidedly different from the others. Theirs had plastic eggs and chocolate bunnies. Mine had kolbasi, ham, bacon, pascha, hrudka, chrin, butter, etc. You know, a <em>traditional</em> Easter basket with all the foods for Sunday&rsquo;s fast-breaking.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
