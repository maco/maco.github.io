<p>I work for a news company, so the presidential election is a huge deal; we can&rsquo;t have downtime. I knew which query was our bottleneck, so I optimized it right before the election. This took advantage of a few Elixir features, like atoms, the pin operator, and concurrency primitives.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Attending Code BEAM</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/attending-code-beam/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Mar 2021 14:39:55 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/attending-code-beam/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Last week, <a href="https://github.com/miriampena" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Miriam Pena</a> from the <a href="https://erlef.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Erlang Ecosystem Foundation</a>&rsquo;s education working group mentioned in the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Elixir</a> Slack&rsquo;s channel for women and other minority genders that <a href="http://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-v-america-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Code BEAM V America</a> was coming up.
