I don&rsquo;t live there anymore, but it&rsquo;ll be a nice chance to spend a weekend in downtown Pittsburgh, sort of playing tourist. (I think we can all guess that visiting my parents in the suburbs is nothing like &ldquo;playing tourist,&rdquo; right?)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to getting to see one of my coworkers again. I met him last year at the Code BEAM Lite Mexico City, and he said he&rsquo;s going to be bringing his mom to PyCon this year. I made them a list of touristy things to do in Pittsburgh. The one problem with remote work is that I rarely get to see my coworkers. I like the balance where some companies have annual off-sites, but I don&rsquo;t work at one of those. I&rsquo;ve only met my coworkers by means of personal travel.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Reusable Django Admin Filters</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/reusable-django-admin-filters/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 14:14:01 -0400</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/reusable-django-admin-filters/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s fairly common to have a many-to-many connection to a <code>User</code> model. But sometimes, you have a <em>lot</em> of users in that table.</p>
<h2 id="problem-1-relations-to-large-tables-are-unwieldy">Problem 1: relations to large tables are unwieldy</h2>
<p>If we let the Django Admin load every single user into the dropdown in the Django Admin, it&rsquo;s unusable. The dropdowns are too long. The page takes too long to load. We need to filter it in advance.</p>

Just because it&rsquo;ll be mainly developers (and a few project managers) seeing it doesn&rsquo;t mean I can neglect usability. Consequently, I spend some time on hacking the Django admin. My manager says I&rsquo;ve been making it do things he didn&rsquo;t even realize were possible.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
