<p>Due to tornadoes in Florida, my flight was delayed, so I missed the opening performance, but I made it to the opening night milonga (dance party) and met some new friends there.</p>
<p>Friday, I really overdid it. I took like 5 dance classes and then went to that night&rsquo;s milonga and stayed until I don&rsquo;t know what time at night. In any case, walking down the hostel stairs the next day for breakfast was painful. I decided to have a more relaxed Saturday; I took a musicality class, went to the beach, came back for a panel discussion, then had dinner and a cortadito before that night&rsquo;s milonga. That cortadito was very helpful since they decided to keep the milonga going until 3am instead of the scheduled 1:30.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>2023 Summary: Part 5</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-5/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>At the end of <a href="/posts/2023-summary-part-4" rel="">part 4</a>, I said I&rsquo;d decided to round off my world travel by visiting my colleagues in Argentina.</p>
<h2 id="buenos-aires">Buenos Aires</h2>
<p>I spent the week before Thanksgiving in Buenos Aires. Finally, my spouse got to come along on one of these trips.</p>
<p>We learned you should not arrive in Buenos Aires on a Sunday. Nothing is open. No, you can&rsquo;t buy a sube (metro card) to ride the subte (metro). No, you can&rsquo;t go to Western Union to convert your dollars to pesos. You want to eat breakfast? There are two restaurants within 4 blocks that open before noon. But the weather was lovely, so we spent the morning sitting in various parks, enjoying it, and marveling at the telecoms cables draped from building to building.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>2023 Summary: Part 3</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 14:00:00 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-3/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>When I left off in <a href="/posts/2023-summary-part-2" rel="">part 2</a>, I said I spent July circumnavigating the globe. Also, I mentioned that I had started studying Swahili.</p>
<h2 id="kenya">Kenya</h2>
<h3 id="nairobi">Nairobi</h3>
<p>My group of Quakers (<a href="https://bym-rsf.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Baltimore Yearly Meeting</a>)   is associated with both <a href="https://www.fgcquaker.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Friends General Conference</a> (more liberal, no pastors) and <a href="https://fum.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Friends United Meeting</a> (often more conservative, usually pastors). Every 3 years, FUM has their triennial. Ok, that&rsquo;s obvious in the name. Anyway, the largest group of FUM Quakers is in Kenya, and it was their turn to host. I arrived a day early and met up with one of the other Baltimore folks for a visit to the Giraffe Centre.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>2023 Summary: Part 2</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 13:00:00 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-2/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>In May, I went up to Pittsburgh for Mothers&rsquo; Day weekend. My brother&rsquo;s New Zealand work visa had come through, so he was saying goodbye to the family.</p>
<h2 id="exam-results">Exam results</h2>
<p>In June, I got the notification that I had passed my <a href="https://www.dele.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">DELE exam</a>. Woot!</p>
<p>The breakdown on scoring is a maximum of 25 points each for reading comprehension, writing skill, listening comprehension, and vocal interaction. You need 30 points total between reading and writing and again between listening and speaking.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>2023 Summary: Part 1</title><link>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><author>Mackenzie Morgan</author><guid>https://mackenzie.morgan.name/posts/2023-summary-part-1/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s the end of December, and I&rsquo;ve barely blogged this year, so I&rsquo;m going to do a wrap-up for the year. 2023 was an <strong>extremely</strong> full year. There was an absolute <strong>ton</strong> of travel and a lot of being usefully bilingual.</p>
<p>There was so much stuff that I&rsquo;m splitting this into <strong>5 parts</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="belgium">Belgium</h2>
<p>At the beginning of February, I went to Belgium to speak in the Elixir/Erlang track at FOSDEM. My friend Nelson was also speaking on that track, and so our mutual friends Pablo and Diego came up from Spain to attend the conference too. We all stayed in the same hotel and stuck together the whole time. We introduced Pablo and Diego to Ethiopian food (Nelson had already tried it with me when visiting DC last year), and we all went to the only Cuban restaurant in Belgium our last night there. After explaining to the Spanish guys what <em>we</em> think of when we hear the word &ldquo;tamal&rdquo; (corn meal, with a stuffing, wrapped in a leaf), Nelson and I were very surprised to learn about tamal en cazuela, which is a casserole: no stuffing, and no leaf. It was tasty, though! Speaking Spanish even came in handy in Belgium in the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t speak French, you don&rsquo;t speak English, any chance we both speak Spanish? Oh good!&rdquo; way.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
